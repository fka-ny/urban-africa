    Love potion,<br>
    Grow with me;<br>
    Urban Africa,<br>
    Come with me;<br>
    To look into your eyes for love.<br>
    Honey boy,<br>
    Honey girl,<br>
    Living in a ghost town without hope;<br>
    Put it on,<br>
    The look in your eyes;<br>
    I don't want to be alone.<br>

    <p>Searching into the woods,<br>
    Love of the common people;<br>
    Searching into the forest,<br>
    Like the voice of the people;<br>
    Searching into the hills,<br>
    I don't want to be left outside;<br>
    Take it easy to come into my home.<br></p>

    Put it off,<br>
    Don't give up!<br>
    Like a visit to the Pegasus Hotel in New Kingston.<br>
    Go to school,<br>
    Learn to rule;<br>
    But, don't be a footstool.<br>
    Love potion,<br>
    Just one drop;<br>
    Of the Ghettos in the country side.<br>
    Just one act,<br>
    Uptown youths;<br>
    Just one love,<br>
    Living in a village called Mandella.<br>

    <p>The dance of the people,<br>
    The tribe of the people,<br>
    The language of the people,<br>
    Of the old school and the new school;<br>
    Like the Banana Republic with love.<br>
    The love potion,<br>
    Living in a vilaage called Mandella;<br>
    Yet still, they do have hope for tomorrow.<br></p>
